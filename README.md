## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide insights from the NYC Citi bike-sharing program and provide a proposal to investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business. Based on the data we are provided of the NYC Citi bike-sharing program, the below visualization is prepared:
* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Results

## Summary
We can assume from the graphs above that most of the citibike riders in NYC are work commuters instead of tourists since the peak times of the rides are during rush hours in the morning (7-9am) and in the afternoon (4-7pm). In NYC, majority of the riders are male, which is however, unnecessarily significant for the proposal. In addition to that, the peak ride time in NYC is around 5 minutes, which can be taken in consideration when building the bike-sharing program in Des Moines. Considering Des Moines is a less populated city than NYC, the distance between bike stations should be adjusted accordingly since the distance between places in Des Moines is relatively further.
